\section{Bounding the Regulator}

To define the regulator of a rational elliptic curve, we must first define the na\"ive logarithmic height, N\'eron-Tate canonical height and the N\'eron-Tate pairing on points on $E$.

Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $\QQ$ and $P \in E(\QQ)$ a rational point on $E$. 

\begin{definition}
The {\it na\"ive logarithmic height} of $P$ is a measure of the ``complexity'' of the coefficients of $P$. Specifically, any non-identity rational point $P$ may be written as $P = (\frac{a}{d^2},\frac{b}{d^3})$, with $a,b,d \in \ZZ$, $d>0$ and $\gcd(a,b,d) = 1$; we then define the na\"ive height of $P$ to be
\begin{equation}
	h(P) := \ln(d).
\end{equation}
Moreover, define $h(\cO) = 0$.
\end{definition}
If you compute the na\"ive heights of a number of points on an elliptic curve, you'll notice that the na\"ive height function is ``almost a quadratic form'' on $E$. That is $h(nP) \sim n^2 h(P)$ for integers $n$, up to some constant that doesn't depend on $P$. We can turn $h$ into a true quadratic form as follows:

\begin{definition}
The {\it N\'eron-Tate height} height function $\hat{h}: E(\QQ) \to \RR$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\hat{h}(P) := \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{h(2^n P)}{(2^n)^2},
\end{equation}
where $h$ is the na\"ive logarithmic height defined above.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[N\'eron-Tate]
N\'eron-Tate has defines a canonical quadratic form on $E(\QQ)$ modulo torsion. That is,
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For all $P,Q \in E(\QQ)$,
	\begin{equation}
		\hat{h}(P+Q) + \hat{h}(P-Q) = 2\left[ \hat{h}(P) + \hat{h}(Q)\right]
	\end{equation}
	i.e. $\hat{h}$ obeys the parallelogram law;
	\item For all $P \in E(\QQ)$ and $n \in \ZZ$,
	\begin{equation}
		\hat{h}(nP) = n^2 \hat{h}(P)
	\end{equation}
	\item $\hat{h}$ is even, and the pairing $\langle\;,\;\rangle: E(\QQ)\times E(\QQ) \to \RR$ by
	\begin{equation}
		\langle P,Q \rangle = \hat{h}(P+Q) - \hat{h}(P) - \hat{h}(Q)
	\end{equation}
	is bilinear;
	\item $\hat{h}(P) = 0$ iff $P$ is torsion;
	\item We may replace $h$ with another height function on $E(\QQ)$ that is ``almost quadratic'' without changing $\hat{h}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

For a proof of this theorem and elaboration on the last point, see \cite[pp. 227-232]{Sil-1985}.

\begin{definition}
The {\it N\'eron-Tate pairing} on $E/\QQ$ is the bilinear form $\langle\;,\;\rangle: E(\QQ)\times E(\QQ) \to \RR$ by
	\begin{equation}
		\langle P,Q \rangle = \hat{h}(P+Q) - \hat{h}(P) - \hat{h}(Q)
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}
Note that this definition may be extended to all pairs of points over $\QQbar$, but the definition above suffices for our purposes. \\

If $E(\QQ)$ has rank $r$, then $E(\QQ)/E_{\text{tor}}(\QQ) \hookrightarrow \RR^r$ under the quadratic form $\hat{h}$ as a (rank $r$) lattice.

\begin{definition}
The {\it regulator} $\Reg_E$ of $E/\QQ$ is the covolume of the lattice that is the image of $E(\QQ)$ under $\hat{h}$. That is, if $\set{P_1,\ldots,P_r}$ generates $E(\QQ)$, then
\begin{equation}
	\Reg_E = \det\left(\langle P_i,P_j\rangle \right)_{1 \le i,j \le r}
\end{equation}
where $\left(\langle P_i,P_j\rangle \right)_{1 \le i,j \le r}$ is the matrix whose $(i,j)$th entry is the value of the pairing $\langle P_i,P_j\rangle$. If $E/\QQ$ has rank zero, then $\Reg_E$ is defined to be 1.
\end{definition}
Note that if $E/\QQ$ has rank 1, then its regulator is just the smallest height of a non-torsion point $P \in E(\QQ)$. \\

Loosely, the regulator measures the ``density'' of rational points on $E$: positive rank elliptic curves with small regulators have many points with small coordinates, while those with large regulators have few such points.\\

It turns out that one can construct elliptic curves with arbitrarily large regulators (for example, fix some $x_0$ and $y_0$ with large denominators, and then find $A$ and $B$ such that $P=(x,y)$ lies on $E: y^2 = x^2 + Ax + B$). However, the more interesting question to ask -- and the one that is relevant to this thesis -- is ``how small can the regulator get?''. Specifically, given $E/\QQ$ with discriminant $D_E$, what is the smallest $\Reg_E$ can be as a function of $D_E$?

This is an open question. However, the following conjecture has been made by Lang \cite{Lang-1997}:

\begin{conjecture}
Let $E/\QQ$ have minimal discriminant $\Delta_E$. There exists an absolute constant $M_0 >0$ independent of $E$ such that any non-torsion point $P \in E(\QQ)$ satisfies
\begin{equation}
\hat{h}(P) >= M_0 \log |\Delta_E| .
\end{equation}
\end{conjecture}
That is, the minimum height of a non-torsion point on $E$ scales with the log of the absolute value of the curve's minimal discriminant. Hindry and Silverman in \cite{HiS-1988} show that the abc conjecture implies Lang's height conjecture; since we are already assuming strong abc, we have this result for free. \\

Since the conductor of a curve always divides the minimal discriminant, an immediate consequence of the height conjecture is the following:
\begin{corollary}
Let $E/\QQ$ have conductor $N_E$. There exists an absolute constant $M_1 >0$ independent of $E$ such that any non-torsion point $P \in E(\QQ)$ satisfies
\begin{equation}
\hat{h}(P) >= M_0 \log N_E .
\end{equation}
\end{corollary}
(Note that the two versions of the height conjecture are fully equivalent under Szpiro's Conjecture). \\

\begin{conjecture}
$M_0 = 0.000213016731929803\ldots$ and $M_1 = 0.00107510998642534\ldots$; these two constants are attained by the rank 1 curve $E: y^2+xy+y=x^3+x^2-125615x+61201397$ with Cremona label {\tt 3990v1}, conductor $N_E = 3990$ and minimal discriminant $\Delta_E = -1494018600480000000$. Furthermore, the curve's generator for the group of rational points $P = (7107,-602054)$ and its negative attain the minimum height of any non-torsion point on any elliptic curve over $\QQ$, namely $\hat{h}(P) = 0.00891432445568635\ldots$.
\end{conjecture}
This conjecture is grounded on numerical evidence. 

This allows us to bound the regulator of $E$ from below in terms of its conductor and the global constant $M_1$:
\begin{theorem}
Let $E/\QQ$ have conductor $N_E$. Assume strong abc, and let $M_1$ be the absolute constant in Lang's height conjecture. Then
\begin{equation}
\Reg_E \ge \text{What goes here?}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $E$ have minimal discriminant $\Delta_E$ and algebraic rank $r$. Since $|\Delta_E|\ge N_E$, it follows that 
\begin{equation*}
\Reg_E \ge \left(M_1 \log N_E \right)^r \ge M_1^r
\end{equation*}
Numerically we determine that $M_1 < 1$. For example, the rank 1 curve with Cremonal label {\tt 1430k1} has a group generator with height $0.009739\ldots$; its regulator is therefore the same value. We thus must have that $M_1 \le 0.00974/\log(1430) = 0.001340\ldots$.

From Lemma ??? we have that $r < \frac{1}{5}\log N$; hence 

\end{proof}
